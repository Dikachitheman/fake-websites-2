# Fake Web Sources

This folder hosts the simulated web ecosystem for Dockie's upcoming `web_search` tool.

## Architecture

- There are **12 separate fake websites**.
- Each website should live in its **own standalone React app** inside `fake-websites/<site-id>`.
- Each app is intended for **independent Vercel deployment**.
- Each app exposes a machine-readable `public/search-index.json` endpoint.
- The backend should use [sources.json](sources.json) as the source registry for discovery and routing.

## Site Inventory

## Product Decisions Captured Here

- Simulated web articles are for `web_search`, not the internal knowledge base.
- Fake sites are **separate React apps**, not one shared multi-brand app.
- The agent should decide when `web_search` is needed.
- Hybrid ranking should vary by question type rather than always preferring the same source class.

## Expected App Structure

Each site folder should follow a lightweight static shape:

```text
fake-websites/<site-id>/
  package.json
  vite.config.ts
  index.html
  src/
  public/
    search-index.json
```

## Backend Expectations

The future `web_search` tool should:

1. Load `sources.json`.
2. Use `search_routing` to narrow the candidate sites by topic when possible.
3. Search each site's `search-index.json`.
4. Return ranked results with citation-safe metadata: title, URL, source, dates, tags, summary, and match reason.
